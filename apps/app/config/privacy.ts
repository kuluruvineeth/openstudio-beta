### Privacy Policy
---------------------------------

### Your Data, Your Control
We believe in transparency. Here's exactly what happens with your information when you use OpenStudio.

### What We Gather
#### 1. Information You Share
- **The Basics**: When you create your account, we collect essential details like your name and email.
- **Authentication**: We use Google or GitHub login to keep things secure and simple.
- **Your Content**: Everything you create stays right where it belongs - on your device.

#### 2. Behind-the-Scenes Data
- **Technical Stuff**: We automatically receive some basic info like your IP address and device type - it's like a digital handshake.
- **Usage Patterns**: We use smart tools to understand how our platform performs, but we keep it minimal.

### How We Keep Your Trust
- **Local-First Storage**: Think of your browser as your personal vault - all your chats, API keys, and settings live there, not on our servers.
- **Direct Communication**: Your messages travel straight to the AI models through encrypted channels. We're just the traffic director.
- **Proxy Protection**: Sometimes we act as a secure middleman for certain AI models, but we never peek at what's passing through.
- **Clean Code Promise**: We keep things simple - no sneaky external scripts running in the background.
- **Your Right to Delete**: Want to start fresh? You can wipe all your data anytime - it's your call.

### Tools We Use to Improve
We partner with some best-in-class services to make OpenStudio better:
- **Arcjet**: Protects our application and users from security threats
- **BetterStack**: Monitors our system health and performance
- **Clerk**: Handles secure user authentication
- **Google Analytics**: Helps us understand website traffic and usage patterns
- **Lemon Squeezy** or **Stripe**: Processes payments securely and reliably
- **PostHog**: Provides insights to improve your product experience
- **Resend**: Manages our email communications
- **Sentry**: Keeps an eye out for technical hiccups so we can fix them fast

These partners follow strict privacy rules too - you can check out their policies anytime.

### Cookie Policy
We keep it crumb-free! While OpenStudio itself doesn't use cookies, our authentication system and some of our helper tools (like PostHog and Sentry) might drop a few to keep things running smoothly. Your browser settings are the boss here - you decide what to accept.

### External Content
Sometimes our AI might suggest links or images from around the web. While we can't vouch for every destination, we want you to know that these are AI-generated suggestions, not endorsements from us.

### Let's Chat
Got questions about your privacy? We're here to help!
Reach out anytime at [kuluruvineeth8623@gmail.com](mailto:kuluruvineeth8623@gmail.com) - we're all about clear communication.

### Updates
We'll keep this policy fresh and up-to-date. Any major changes? We'll make sure you know about them.
