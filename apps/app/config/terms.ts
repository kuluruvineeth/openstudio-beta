### Terms and Conditions
--------------------------------
Last Updated: January 14, 2025

Welcome to OpenStudio! By diving into our platform, you're agreeing to these ground rules. Let's keep things clear and simple.

### 1. Getting Started
When you use OpenStudio, you're automatically accepting these terms - it's like a digital handshake between us. If something doesn't sit right with you, we understand, but you'll need to step away from the platform.

### 2. Quick Definitions
- "Platform" - Everything OpenStudio offers: our website, tools, and services
- "You" - Anyone exploring or using our platform
- "Content" - All the good stuff: text, images, code, or anything else shared through our platform

### 3. Your Privacy Matters
Here's the deal: we're serious about privacy. Your chats? They stay on your device. We don't peek, store, or access your conversations. Think of it like having your own private notebook - we just provide the pages.

### 4. Authentication Required
A login is required to use our platform. This helps us maintain security and provide you with a personalized experience. Think of it as your personal key to access all our features and services.

### 5. House Rules
Keep it clean, keep it legal. That means:
- No shady business or illegal activities
- Play nice with others
- Don't try to break or hack the system

### 6. Account Status
We might need to show you the door if things go south. We can pause or close accounts that break our rules - no warning needed. It's like having a reset button for when things aren't working out.

### 7. What You Get
We're upfront: our platform comes "as is." While we strive for excellence, we can't promise perfection. Since your chats live on your device, keeping them safe is in your hands - like having your own digital vault.

### 8. Responsibility Limits
Real talk: we're not liable for:
- Hiccups in service
- Unexpected visitors (hackers)
- Data whoopsies
- Any other bumps in the road

### 9. Your Part of the Deal
If something goes wrong and it's tied to your use of OpenStudio, you're agreeing to have our back - legally and financially speaking.

### 10. Legal Framework
We're playing by Indian rules here. If we need to sort something out legally, the courts in Bengaluru, Karnataka (India) will have exclusive jurisdiction. All matters will be governed by the laws of India.

### 11. Rolling with Changes
We might update these terms occasionally. When we make big changes, we'll give you a heads-up on our website. Sticking around means you're cool with the updates.
